# NumberSpeller
A number speller in Arabic language, this program uses SFML audio header for playing sounds.
this program spell the numbers that you entered in the console in the Arabic language.
You can change the sounds (voices) in the sounds folder with your own one, but you have to rename it like the old one.

You can change the extension of sound files, but you have to rename every single path in the main.cpp file and recompile it.
(Quote from https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/audio-sounds.php):
SFML supports the audio file formats WAV, OGG/Vorbis and FLAC. Due to licensing issues MP3 is not supported.
